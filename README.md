[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/pythonumerical.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/pythonumerical)

## Description

This is a Python package that includes some basic numerical analysis methods. This package is developed and tested using Python 3.5.

**Note:** This is currently a work in progress.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute a numerical method, follow these steps:

1. Create an issue and wait for the repository owner to respond / green light work.
2. Fork the repository and do work in a feature branch. Begin the branch name with the issue number and use hyphens instead of underscores.
3. Please stick to test driven development. Your pull request's first commit should always be a test that remains unchanged in subsequent commits.
4. Stick with the styling and file structure already in the project: append your test method to [tests.py][2] and add your module to [core/][3].
